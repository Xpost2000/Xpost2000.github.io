<P>
Welcome to my Mount and Blade Journey! This is <b>not a fresh</P>


<P>
playthrough</b>, rather this is me simply writing about my current</P>


<P>
on-going playthrough!</P>


<BR/>

<P>
For a "pilot episode" this ends quite disasterously for me. Let's</P>


<P>
start introductions! In the war-torn landmass of Calradia laid a</P>


<P>
humble warband of a hundred men. Lead by a man in steel armor with an</P>


<P>
imposing war-mask.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
That leader is Sean:</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708162756_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Not being the greatest warrior, he is an opportunist. Honorable on a</P>


<P>
whim, and monster in some instances. While his journey began quite</P>


<P>
well, only recently he had begun to find success. Recently opening</P>


<P>
several dyeworks and businesses to the point where he is no longer in</P>


<P>
the red while paying for his warbands' wages.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
With a hundred well-armed and trained men, surely Calradia would fall</P>


<P>
to his knees! In time of course. Sean is ensigned to a mercenary</P>


<P>
contract for the Kingdom of Rhodok, merely because of his previous</P>


<P>
history with the country.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Once upon a time, Sean was a vassal for <b>King Graveth</b> and owned</P>


<P>
the fief of <b>Jelkala</b>. That was the <b>Sarranid Sultante</b></P>


<P>
declared war. Through the campaign set in the fall of 1257, Sean and</P>


<P>
the Counts of Rhodok fought against the Sultante. Unfortunately it was</P>


<P>
realized too late that Sean believed the kingdom was ill-prepared for</P>


<P>
war. One fateful day, Sean had attempted to defend the fief of Jelkala</P>


<P>
from the <b>Sarranid Sultante</b>. Unfortunately the Sarranids came</P>


<P>
with over 300 men, whilst Sean isolated from the remaining Counts</P>


<P>
stood his ground with a mere 80 men.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately as of late Sean had been facing a dry spell. Battles had</P>


<P>
been leading into a great many number of defeats against the vast</P>


<P>
armies of the Sultante. It was after the siege of <b></b> and the loss</P>


<P>
of his fief that Sean was taken prisoner, and from that point forth</P>


<P>
swore vengence against the cursed Sarranids.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Upon his escape, he renounced his vassalship for fear of his life, and</P>


<P>
instead decided to become a mercenary for the kingdom.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately no one said Sean was a very wise man. Still seething</P>


<P>
over his embarrassing defeat, Sean was insulted over the newly</P>


<P>
announced truce between the <b>Kingdom of Rhodok</b> and the</P>


<P>
<b>Sarranid Sultante</b>. He decided to take matters into his own</P>


<P>
hands. Over several passing weeks he would harass the villages of the</P>


<P>
Sarranids, and once his warband grew, he began hunting small</P>


<P>
detachments of Sarranid armies. Emerging victorious for many of them.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
To Sean's expectations, this results in war incited between the</P>


<P>
<b>Kingdom of Rhodok</b> and the <b>Sarranids</b>. Understandably King</P>


<P>
Graveth was quite pissed, and after a couple of weeks, another peace</P>


<P>
treaty was signed.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Fast forward some time, the most recent event of note was the capture</P>


<P>
of <b>Suno</b> by Sean and various counts of the <b>Kingdom of</P>


<P>
Rhodok</b>. Due to the orders of Count Kurnias, attempted to incite a</P>


<P>
war between the <b>Khergit Khanate</b>. Unfortunately this plan didn't</P>


<P>
work, however they are aggressive against Sean for the raids that were</P>


<P>
done against villagers.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
At this point in time Sean has a reputation for beating many leaders</P>


<P>
of the Khergit, and particularly the Sarranid Sultante.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Resuming from present day, Sean had been attempting to train and level</P>


<P>
his men, and had been travelling around the northern part of Calradia.</P>


<P>
He had discovered a band of deserters and decided to go for some easy</P>


<P>
pickings.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163253_1.jpg"/> <img</P>


<P>
src="screenshots/20210708163402_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Expectedly, the deserting Nords were slaughtered and crushed by this</P>


<P>
band of warriors.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Oh cool! The weekly account has been settled! Still in the green.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163708_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways, being quite bored over the state of affairs and itching for a</P>


<P>
battle. Sean finds the Boyer Dhashwal alone on a patrol. As is usual</P>


<P>
for him, he decides to go ahead and battle the Boyer.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Cursed snow-blindness... This battle of 36 against 100... Goes as</P>


<P>
about exactly as you'd expect. A one-sided slaughter.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163910_1.jpg"/> <img</P>


<P>
src="screenshots/20210708163934_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Having scratched his minor itch for battle, Sean quickly discovers</P>


<P>
that the <b>Kingdom of Swadia</b> had declared war on the <b>Kingdom</P>


<P>
of Rhodoks</b>! This might be bad for our many Swadian soldiers... Of</P>


<P>
course, as I discovered, this would be bad in more ways than forcing</P>


<P>
brothers against each other.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Sean decides to travel southwards back into Rhodok territory when he</P>


<P>
encounters Count Despin's Party. Hoping to peck off a few forces, he</P>


<P>
wonders if he can pursue them. However <b>Count Reland</b> orders for</P>


<P>
Sean's appearance. So he heads towards <b>Uxkhal</b> where a healthy</P>


<P>
amount of men are stationed. Seemingly preparing for a siege.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164313_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Reland asks for Sean to follow him, and requests him to scout several</P>


<P>
times. He declines as he finds the work quite menial and frankly</P>


<P>
boring. Eventually he gives up following Reland's party and ventures</P>


<P>
into the wild, searching for more warbands to level his soldiers.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately he gets exactly what he asked for, as Swadian</P>


<P>
<b>Raich</b> approaches.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164542_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Shit! Now he'll see what it's like to be on the other side of a</P>


<P>
massacre. Hundreds of Swadians line up on the other side of the field</P>


<P>
as Sean's mercenaries approach a hill. Seeing the numbers, in spite of</P>


<P>
all sense of self-preservation, he orders his men to battle as they</P>


<P>
always had. As best as he could afford to anyways.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Charging on his Courser he tries to peck off archers as in his</P>


<P>
experience he found them (and Calvarymen) to be amongst the most</P>


<P>
dangerous of his adverseries. While the battle was violent and</P>


<P>
bloody. Sean and his party were at the very least seeming to manage</P>


<P>
against the first detachment. Bodies strewn across the battlefield,</P>


<P>
while horses without their riders gallop wildly. A chaotic confusion</P>


<P>
in the battlefield as any remaining semblance of tactics disappeared.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164627_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Of course, this was only the first detachment. While not to his</P>


<P>
surprise, but very much to his horror. He witnessed the second half of</P>


<P>
the 250 men approaching.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164828_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
After the first initial defeat, Sean recovers enough to try one last</P>


<P>
stand...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708165105_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
16 men against 86... While the party had done quite a number, all it</P>


<P>
took was a single arrow to knock Sean off his horse unconsious.  Upon</P>


<P>
recovery, he decided his life was worth more than honor, and he fled.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately the Count was quite persistent, and eventually caught</P>


<P>
Sean. The bastard! Seeing no choice as fight or not would end in</P>


<P>
defeat. He decided to follow what would've happened anyways...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708165123_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Upon surrender Sean had lost nearly all of his companions. Fortunately</P>


<P>
he was left his arms and armor. With a meager 3 men, he had to set out</P>


<P>
and rebuild his warband again. The only solace taken was that he would</P>


<P>
consistently make a 3000 denar profit each week due to the lack of</P>


<P>
wages to pay.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
So with this in mind, Sean had a set out across the few non-hostile</P>


<P>
villages (which basically only included the Kingdom of Rhodok and the</P>


<P>
Nords) and attempted to recruit villagers. Along the way Sean had to</P>


<P>
battle yet another Count.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708170646_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Sean unfortunately recognizes that this is not a Swadian. Rather a</P>


<P>
former Emir, who had defected from the Sarranids. However he can</P>


<P>
honestly remember if this was one of the many Emirs he battled, and</P>


<P>
nor did he care. Foreseeing this would be another lopsided massacre,</P>


<P>
Sean sacrifices a few men and flees with the survivors.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately this has proven to be quite the bad Spring, as in spite</P>


<P>
of this the Emir caught up, and decided to beat the living shit out of</P>


<P>
his party.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708170943_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Fortunately this time, Sean survives without getting held prisoner,</P>


<P>
and escapes. Continuing his recruitment of soldiers. He believes he</P>


<P>
should recruit as many Rhodok crossbow men, and find as many</P>


<P>
calvarymen to compensate against his enemies.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Yet again however, he is accousted by yet more armies...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708171431_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately I cannot recount whether I actually won this or</P>


<P>
not... All I recall is that I was not taken prisoner after the first</P>


<P>
time. After the scars of March and Feburary, Sean continues his goal</P>


<P>
of recruiting more and more men.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
This episode concludes with the final party composition:</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708172225_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
This is going to be a very rough recovery.</P>

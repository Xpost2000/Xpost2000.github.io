<p id="display">Tutorial 4: Input + Arrays!!</p>
<div id="body">
<p>So I'm going to assume first you want the code right? Here it is.</p>
<iframe src="src/tut4src.html" width="500", height="175"></iframe>
<div class="bd">
	<p>Something actually interesting?</p>
</div>
<h1>Scanner Class</h1>
<div class="b">
	<p>Take a look at the code and you'll see something new to the start of the file </p>
	<b><i><p style="font-size:15px;">import java.util.Scanner;</p></b></i>
	<p>In most programming languages they provide with standard utility functions for general purpose things</p>
	<p>this line states that we want this Scanner utility to use in our program.</p>
</div>
	<h2>What does it do?</h2>
	<div class="b">
		<p>As the title of the lesson implies, it will allow you to recieve input.</p>
		<p>What is input? It allows your program to take commands from your pc specifically</p>
		<p>your keyboard.</p>
		<p>Here is the syntax for creating a scanner</p>
		<b><i><p style="font-size:15px;">Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)</p></b></i>
		<p>then to use the scanner do this | sc.next[datatype]();</p>
		<p style="font-size:35px;">NOTE: Scanners can take input from files as well!</p>
	</div>
	<h1>Arrays!</h1>
	<iframe src="src/tut4Src2.html" width="735", height="255"></iframe>
	<div class="bd">
		<p>A convient way of making multiple variables for the price of one!</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="b">
		<p>So we talked just a bit about arrays. But we haven't seen or used them yet?</p>	
		<p>Well we are now! But let's first define what an arrays is.</p>
	</div>
		<p style="font-size:22px;">An Array is a variable that stores other variables. Or put simply, more than one value concurrently.</p>
	<div class="b">
		<p>Arrays also like standard variables have only one set type.</p>
		<p>This means a array that is an int may not store types that are Strings. Unlike standard variables however</p>
		<p>An array must <b>STRICTLY</b> use it's <b> OWN TYPE </b>, unless you typecast it but that's a different lesson.</p>
		<p>The syntax for declaring / defining an array is not too complicated and is relatively easy to grasp.</p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>*datatype* *variablename* [] = new *datatype*[*sizeofarray*]</i></b></p>
		<p>Here is an example</p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>float number[] = new number[512];</i></b></p>
		<p>Now your liking asking, how do I assign values to arrays?</p>
		<p>Arrays assign values to their indices, which are what contains a variable.</p>
		<p>Arrays are infact memory address pointing to other memory address that it owns(You make new memory with the <b>new</b> keyword)</p>
		<p>Since making arrays can consume more memory than making a singular variable. Don't make an array bigger than you need.</p>
		<p>Now to access the indices of an array.</p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>*variablename*[*indexNumber*] = *valueThatMatchesDataType*</i></b></p>
		<p>Example</p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>number[256] = 125.1918f;</i></b></p>
		<p>One thing to note</p>
		<p><b>The first index is ZERO, not ONE as you would believe</b></p>
		<p>this is because that arrays require one byte reserved to be the terminating byte. Which is the escape code \0</p>
		<p>Most modern and advanced languages automatically add it on, but if you do not have one and use a lower level language</p>
		<p>like assembly, your variable will access memory that doesn't belong to it and output absolute GARBAGE (with a free program crash!).</p>
		<p>back to the assignment of array values. Well if you have a big array isn't it going to be redundant?</p>
		<b><p>Yes... Yes it is, this why we use our friend, the FOR LOOP</p></b>
		<p>Down below is the common implementation of a for loop to fill an array</p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>for ( int i = 0;; i &#60 *size*; i++ )</i></b></p>
		<p style="font-size:15px;"><b><i>array[i] = *value*</i></b></p>
		<p>see? Much less annoying than doing a hundred lines of array[*number*] = *value* eh?</p>
		<h2>Arrays don't have to be specified types. WHA???</h2>
		<p>Yep that's right. Arrays are not just limited to the standard variable types in Java ( same for other languages )</p>
		<p>Once we get to Object Orientation you'll see examples of this in action, just keep this as a hint for the future</p>
		<p>Hope this was informative and see you next time :D</p>

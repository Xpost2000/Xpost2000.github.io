          This is my projects section. This is not necessarily a portfolio page, but may contain portfolio worthy projects.
          These are mostly just C projects that either consist of tools or games. Maybe the occasional web development project,
          but those are pretty rare. Most things here are probably on my Github, and likely licensed as MIT or GNU GPL v3.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If it is not a significant project or is a small test tool, it's probably not licensed and should just be implicitly
          publically domained as far as I'm concerned.

          Much like the blog page, this too should've been generated by a handwritten content generator in C. If nothing went wrong,
          this should look remarkably similar to the previous generated page as I'm unsure of a way to make this look good at the moment...
          Also do not assume that any of these necessarily happened in order!

          Should this page suddenly support more dynamic features, this might have to be generated on the fly with javascript, but I don't think
          I'll ever do that, since this page should remain pretty small... <b>The page does not generally include released games.</b>

This is my oldest technical game project. It's a simple top down shooter before I discovered the existance of delta-time. I thought
it was really cool when I made it though. You could push crates and shoot enemies, along with loading levels from text files which were
interpreted as tilemaps.

<p>
This is the "sequel" to the previous project. It now sports an OpenGL renderer that used shaders to support a kind of wonky looking
underwater effect. Also there was mouse aim and a basic camera/frustrum culling solution for things. Delta-time was also finally used
so the game was roughly framerate independent.

A polished Pong game made with SDL2. There's literally nothing else to say about this. It was made in the most naive way possible.

This is mistakenly called an ASCII roguelike despite not being a roguelike, though ASCII it is. It was a small
game to do with PDCurses, and it was kind of cool to make. It's not very complicated and rather simplistic. Would
be repeated again in various different projects like Wanderer.

<p>
An incomplete isometric RPG game/engine written in C. This was never hosted on GitHub. It was
hosted on a private Mercurial server instead, because I still think Mercurial is more easily usable
than Git. That's just a personal choice though. It supported an OpenGL based isometric renderer, a custom
config reader, and had a editor for "sprites". It also had a handwritten GUI system that did basic layout,
and rendering was sorted as you would expect. It uses a directed graph for a dialogue system that was also
able to query game state for conditionals.

	<div class="project-description">
<p>
This is a stupid slideshow program written in Rust. It is resolution
and aspect ratio independent. It uses a text based format, as those
are the most flexible format (just write a program to interpret them)
as well as being extremely easy to share and transfer. It supports
slide transitions and images, as well as basic layout. There is
hot-reloading which alleviates that issue. The filebrowser included is
primitive, and prone to breaking however the slideshow portion itself
is fine. Some called it `jerry-slides`. I do not have many opportunities to use
this as many presentations are often in group-work environments(as a student).

Yes, this is definitely meta. This is one of my web development projects. The website went through older iterations and such,
generally which shows my growth as a web developer (which is not much as I don't actively really do it.) A retro computing aesthetic
to resemble an EMACS/VI session was chosen as I really like using those editors, and I think most websites look too generic. The best
experience for this website is to go fullscreen, and use keyboard. Due to the odd design, it is difficult to work this on mobile (much how
mobile VI is not a fun time.)

Well while I'm not the most competitive person, I try my best to float up to a bar and attempt to raise if I can. ARISTA is like a bookmark of my own personal progress. I view progress as competition against yourself, and at minimum I do not wish to fall below my highest peak. ARISTA would give me a way to push myself and even rise higher. I also agree with the mission of ARISTA to help others. Particularly in others' pursuit of knowledge as I find it to be a wonderful experience I'd like to share with others.

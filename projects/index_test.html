My Projects</H1>


<BR/>

<P>
This is my projects section. This is not necessarily a portfolio page, but may contain portfolio projects. Thesee are just C projects
	that mostly consist of either tools or games. Maybe the occasional web development project, but those are pretty rare. Most things here are probably on my Github.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
This like the blog page should've been generated by a Common Lisp generator if nothing went wrong. 
<B>
This page doesn't really contain any released games. Those are just on itch.io</B>

<P>
An incomplete isometric RPG game/engine written in C. This was never hosted on GitHub. It was hosted on a private Mercurial server instead, because I still think Mercurial is more easily usable than Git. That's just a personal choice though. It supported an OpenGL based isometric renderer, a custom config reader, and had a editor for "sprites". It also had a handwritten GUI system that did basic layout, and rendering was sorted as you would expect. It uses a directed graph for a dialogue system that was also able to query game state for conditionals.</P>

<IMG class = "project-thumb" src = "projects/stupid-slideshow//thumb.png" >
</IMG>


<P>
This is a stupid slideshow program written in Rust. It is resolution and aspect ratio independent. It uses a text based format, as those are the most flexible format (just write a program to interpret them) as well as being extremely easy to share and transfer. It supports slide transitions and images, as well as basic layout. There is hot-reloading which alleviates that issue. The filebrowser included is primitive, and prone to breaking however the slideshow portion itself is fine. Some called it `jerry-slides`. I do not have many opportunities to use this as many presentations are often in group-work environments(as a student).</P>

</IMG>


<P>
This is the "sequel" to the previous project. It now sports an OpenGL renderer that used shaders to support a kind of wonky looking underwater effect. Also there was mouse aim and a basic camera/frustrum culling solution for things. Delta-time was also finally used so the game was roughly framerate independent.</P>

<P>
This is my oldest technical game project. It's a simple top down shooter before I discovered the existance of delta-time. I thought it was really cool when I made it though. You could push crates and shoot enemies, along with loading levels from text files which were interpreted as tilemaps.</P>

SDL Pong</P>

<P>
A polished Pong game made with SDL2. There's literally nothing else to say about this. It was made in the most naive way possible.</P>

<P>
Yes, this is definitely meta. This is one of my web development projects. The website went through older iterations and such, generally which shows my growth as a web developer (which is not much as I don't actively really do it.) A retro computing aesthetic to resemble an EMACS/VI session was chosen as I really like using those editors, and I think most websites look too generic. The best experience for this website is to go fullscreen, and use keyboard. Due to the odd design, it is difficult to work this on mobile (much how mobile VI is not a fun time.)</P>

ASCII RPG</P>


<DIV class = "project-description" >
<IMG class = "project-thumb" src = "projects/ascii//ascii.png" >
</IMG>


<P>
This is mistakenly called an ASCII roguelike despite not being a roguelike, though ASCII it is. It was a small game to do with PDCurses, and it was kind of cool to make. It's not very complicated and rather simplistic. Would be repeated again in various different projects like Wanderer.</P>

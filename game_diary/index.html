Jerry's Game Diary</H1>


<P>
Welcome to the Game Diary</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Remember when I said I love playing video games?</P>


<P>
This is a secondary blog that is categorized by games I've played. Some I've finished</P>


<P>
and simply replaying them again. Or some are completely fresh that I'm playing fresh.</P>


<P>
This is kind of going to be like those old school RPG game journal things, but with just random</P>


<P>
games, since I recording let's plays is hard, and this is much more easier.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Since I will write down whatever happens. It is likely I will start the diary with games in the middle of playthroughs</P>


<P>
because for obvious reasons I'm not going to replay the game just to get a more honest overview.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Also I might even forget to update, since I would like to enjoy myself playing these games. I do like sharing the experiences</P>


<P>
but it might take longer to write these than it does for me to play a session lol. (The Mount and Blade was 1 hour of playtime and that
        	 took like 2 hours to write I think... Maybe a bit less or more.)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Click on any of the games to be taken to their respective diary pages if they exist!</P>


<BR/>

<P>
NOTE: these are obviously going to be lots of reading, so try to not read multiple of them. I may not be able to write</P>


<P>
fanfictions, but this is as close as I can get.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I have personally only written entries on Mount & Blade: Warband, so you can also consider this a "favorites" list.</P>

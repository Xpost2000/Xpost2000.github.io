<P>
Whoops I kind of forgot to write a post-jam entry.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways I guess this is that entry. As all game-jams it's quite the</P>


<P>
hectic weekend. I'm very pleased that in my opinion the game quality / polish is</P>


<P>
higher (even regarding assets excluding music).</P>


<BR/>

<P>
So that means I'm getting faster at making games I guess.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Although I have not made games in a hot minute, so my code architecture skills regarding games</P>


<P>
is kind of bricked, and not as good as it could be. (This is multiplied in Godot as I typically don't</P>


<P>
use external game engines.)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways, should anyone wonder what I've been doing the past couple of days. I was binging on anime. I got</P>


<P>
around to watching Re;Zero, and it was horribly depressing. Great show though. For some reason I've been binging</P>


<P>
anime a lot more frequently in the past year, and I'm not really sure if that's out of character for me or not.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
That'll be all then!</P>

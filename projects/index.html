<p>Welcome to the projects section of my site</p>
<br></br>
<p>Over here we have my few projects that I made for practice and fun</p>
<p>Most of these are not complete but are like proof of concepts and at least playable</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="link">ASCII Roguelike</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Xpost2000/ASCII-Roguelike" ><img src="ascii.png" width="420" height="262.5" alt="Placeholder"></img></a>
<p class="desc">This is one of my first projects (I publically made avaliable). A simple game, nothing too complex</p>

<p class="desc">A top down shooter. my first one and one of my more bigger projects</p>

<p class="desc">Oh yeah. Did I mention it's probably the first thing I finish? Like absolutely finished.</p>
<p class="desc">Not like the other projects where I leave it in a perputal(I'll fix the spelling if it's wrong) state of limbo.</p>

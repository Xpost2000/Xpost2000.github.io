No I didn't forget this site existed, I just don't really like doing web development or design. Okay I've just kind of been lazy and maybe did forget about this website for a few seconds or something like that. </p>
<br>
<p>
If I don't forget to do anything later, I'll probably write or reuse a similar static content generator for the remaining portions of the website. Mostly the project parts. </p>
<br>
<p>
I'm likely just going to stick with this style of the website (old VI style), and probably add a few nice features like theme switching... </p>
<br>
<p>
I've been doing web development for a classmate's organization, which while I'm not too plussed with having to use these frameworks or particularly happy with using them. I did find a bit of enjoyment during some select portions. </p>
<br>
<p>
I'm definitely going to need to reorganize this repository to be more clear, and also probably change the static generator into something a little more advanced than a printf machine. </p>
<br>
<p>
Though I don't suspect anything complicated will be required for a pretty long while, and I can probably just hand-code the static generators in a special way in basically C scripts. </p>
<br>
<p>
If I really can't bear to do it in C (when it gets too cumbersome), I'll probably just switch to doing it with a python or common lisp script or something like that. I do endeavor to handwrite as much of this website as I possibly can without resorting to external dependencies because I do not wish to wait for thousands of packages to install on a Windows 7 machine (Professional still has support!) </p>
<br>
<p>
Also either way, this is much more sane to do in my opinion. I'm still rather green as far as things are still concerned, so maybe my rant is a bit unfounded. Okay I'm not going to lie, doing some styling does make me a little giddy sometimes. </p>
<br>
<p>
Anyways that's it for now. <br>

It's kind of almost an exaggeration to call this a CMS,
but technically it does manage content.

It makes writing blogs a lot easier than before since it
generates my files, and stuff. However it's extraordinarily
limited.

Thankfully my blogs are only text files, so I do not really
need much else.

If I need more, I can just use markdown, and maybe defer steps when
publishing I suppose.

Right now, it's a write-once -> commit/publish. It would be more flexible
to separate this into multiple steps, however I don't need it so I'll keep it
the way it is at the moment since it's very simple.

Yay to the power of bash.

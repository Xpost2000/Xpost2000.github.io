<P>
I'm incredibly lazy so I'm just going to use my commit message as</P>


<P>
an entry.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways, as it can be assumed. It's going about as well as I could expect.</P>


<P>
Although I will at least say this went way better than 7DRL imo. Even though</P>


<P>
I now have about 51 hours left or something like that.</P>


<P>
====================================================================</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Last few works of the day. Small polish things.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Camera is getting some polish functionality added in, since</P>


<P>
this is my last amount of actual work I designated...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
So while I didn't get a complete skeleton. I guess it's not too</P>


<P>
terrible, however this is like the "stretching" it point... Although</P>


<P>
this makes me confident enough that it can be finished mostly by saturday</P>


<P>
with sunday to do last minute polish or some asset stuff...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
God how I wish Godot had an IMGUI cause that was probably the worst part of</P>


<P>
this experience.</P>

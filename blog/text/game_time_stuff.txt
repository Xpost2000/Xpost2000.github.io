Game Time Stuff

I'm adding a game diaries thing so I can write down my gaming
experiences.

Which is frankly the stupidest and most unoriginal thing, but who cares right?

Games are fun, and I have a pretty big backlog to clear (although SteamDB says I've played
80% of the games I have in my library. In reality I've played like maybe 30/100 something I own.)

For now this'll probably just be my Steam games, as in the in-progress page automatically builds from
steam information.

Unfortunately I cannot write about my console games since my consoles are broken. Though I would love to
regale the God Of War and Little Big Planet days.

Anyways it's a crapton of infrastructure to automate all of this, so oddly enough this website is robust in
the weirdest way. Though surprisingly it's not a lot of code to generate most of this.

1678 lines of code for CSS + Lisp which is cool. There's 362 lines of C from when I was still using that generator.

So I guess overall I'm pretty satisifed with the way this website "grew." Back when I handwrote all the HTML to now
writing a thing that writes the HTML for me. Website builds very fast and iteration time is relatively quick in my opinion
for my needs (the C generator can be compiled and run fresh in less than a second, the common lisp generator takes one second
to build all pages (from the makefile, each individual page is built fast, so I'll just chalk it to Windows being bad at process
forking.))

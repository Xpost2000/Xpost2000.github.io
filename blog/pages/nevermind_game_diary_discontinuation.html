<P>
For obvious reasons it's probably too cumbersome to record what is essentially a playthrough</P>


<P>
using just text.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
So I'll probably just use it to store some interesting or noteworthy moments from those games.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Instead of a fullplaythrough-isque thing like I thought I was going to do. Somehow it takes a few hours</P>


<P>
to get a mediocre piece of text to describe an hour of text.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Writing is hard, who knew?</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Anyways at least it got me to refactor the blog generation code to be much easier since now it's basically</P>


<P>
just doing a basic</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
(Please work correctly. I have no idea how this might show up</P>


<P>
 ALSO TODO: get highlight.js or something. I kind of wish it would do AST based highlighting instead</P>


<P>
 of regex highlighting though, since AST can be more accurate. Oh well.)</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
(let ((blog (install-blog "./text/"))</P>


<P>
      (listings (generate-page-links blog))</P>


<P>
      (links (map 'list #'text-link->page-link (loop for item in blog collect (getf item :link)))))</P>


<P>
    (with-common-page-template</P>


<P>
        :page-title "title here"</P>


<P>
        :current-link-text "minibuffer-text"</P>


<P>
        :body </P>


<P>
         ;; some list that represents HTML, which I can get from the blog files.</P>


<P>
         ;; although this is meant to store a pgae index.</P>


<P>
         ;; GENERATE-PAGE-LINKS, generates all the pages as well. I should probably separate that out.</P>


<P>
         ))</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
So outside of maybe naming reasons, it's pretty usable. I could probably compact installing blog instances into a full function to</P>


<P>
just instantiate blogs through this. And setup some stuff so like</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
;; This would install my full blog instance plus batch script CMS</P>


<P>
;; so it would create copies of my scripts to write-blog-entry and just source</P>


<P>
;; them into my .bashrc so I could just invoke them anywhere... This seems to actually</P>


<P>
;; provide a neat way of producing blog entries, since it hasn't bothered me yet, and seems</P>


<P>
;; pretty fast and easy to do.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
;; Even better, since this uses vim I could ssh and write blog entries too, so that's cool.</P>


<P>
(install-blog-instance "text-location" "output-location")</P>

What I've Been Doing
04/19/2023 01:18 It has been absolutely forever since I've actually written on this site haven't I?

Anyways, after my first year of college a lot of stuff happened. I've lost an uncountable
amount of sleep, and have been inordinarily stressed.

I tried to pickup a new hobby, and got I'd say mediocre at art. I'm actually very proud of it!

I'll put up a section in a little bit for my artwork, since it's something that makes me happy to
do. It's mostly anime style art, which I know has some stigma, but I like to draw it so I'll keep it
that way.

I've been vetting and documenting some select projects, which turns out to be a lot of work and it's good
thing I still remember how everything works for most of them. Definitely the ones I picked at least.

That'll be all for now!

ASCII RPG

This is mistakenly called an ASCII roguelike despite not being a roguelike, though ASCII it is. It was a small
game to do with PDCurses, and it was kind of cool to make. It's not very complicated and rather simplistic. Would
be repeated again in various different projects like Wanderer.

Mount and Blade: Warband is one of those classic Medieval PC games. It's like Totally Accurate Battle Simulator,
but you get to participate in the battles!

Turns out, the ability to participate in battles is really awesome! Also since I'm into medieval combat and knights
and swords. This happens to be a great game to play. It's a dated game though (even for when it came out), but man is
it a lot of fun. Even in a singleplayer, though I've heard multiplayer is one of the mainstays of the game.

As this is a sandbox game. There's not really much to say about the story except for the fact this is about me as I try
to conquer Calradia with a Warband of a hundred men (and growing!)

Enjoy my journey as I live or die into legend! (Or according to the retirement page, I become a thief... Fuck.)

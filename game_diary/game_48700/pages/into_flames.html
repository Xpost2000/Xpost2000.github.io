<P>
Welcome to my Mount and Blade Journey! This is <b>not a fresh playthrough</b>, rather this is me</P>


<P>
simply writing about my current on-going playthrough!</P>


<BR/>

<P>
For a "pilot episode" this ends quite disasterously for me. Let's start introductions! In the war-torn</P>


<P>
landmass of Calradia laid a humble warband of a hundred men. Lead by a man in steel armor with an imposing</P>


<P>
war-mask.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
That leader is Sean:</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708162756_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Not being the greatest warrior, he is an opportunist. Honorable on a whim, and monster in some instances. While</P>


<P>
his journey began quite well, only recently he had begun to find success. Recently opening several dyeworks and</P>


<P>
businesses to the point where he is no longer in the red while paying for his warbands' wages.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
With a hundred well-armed and trained men, surely Calradia would fall to his knees! In time of course. Sean is ensigned</P>


<P>
to a mercenary contract for the Kingdom of Rhodok, merely because of his previous history with the country.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Once upon a time, Sean was a vassal for <b>King Graveth</b> and owned the fief of <b>Jelkala</b>. That was the <b>Sarranid Sultante</b> declared</P>


<P>
war. Through the campaign set in the fall of 1257, Sean and the Counts of Rhodok fought against the Sultante. Unfortunately it</P>


<P>
was realized too late that Sean believed the kingdom was ill-prepared for war. One fateful day, Sean had attempted to defend the</P>


<P>
fief of Jelkala from the <b>Sarranid Sultante</b>. Unfortunately the Sarranids came with over 300 men, whilst Sean isolated from the remaining</P>


<P>
Counts stood his ground with a mere 80 men.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately as of late Sean had been facing a dry spell. Battles had been leading into a great many number of defeats against the vast armies</P>


<P>
of the Sultante. It was after the siege of <b></b> and the loss of his fief that Sean was taken prisoner, and from that point forth swore vengence</P>


<P>
against the cursed Sarranids.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Upon his escape, he renounced his vassalship for fear of his life, and instead decided to become a mercenary for the kingdom.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately no one said Sean was a very wise man. Still seething over his embarrassing defeat, Sean was insulted over the newly announced truce between</P>


<P>
the <b>Kingdom of Rhodok</b> and the <b>Sarranid Sultante</b>. He decided to take matters into his own hands. Over several passing weeks he would harass the</P>


<P>
villages of the Sarranids, and once his warband grew, he began hunting small detachments of Sarranid armies. Emerging victorious for many of them.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
To Sean's expectations, this results in war incited between the <b>Kingdom of Rhodok</b> and the <b>Sarranids</b>. Understandably King Graveth was quite pissed,</P>


<P>
and after a couple of weeks, another peace treaty was signed.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Fast forward some time, the most recent event of note was the capture of <b>Suno</b> by Sean and various counts of the <b>Kingdom of Rhodok</b>. Due to the orders</P>


<P>
of Count Kurnias, attempted to incite a war between the <b>Khergit Khanate</b>. Unfortunately this plan didn't work, however they are aggressive against Sean for the</P>


<P>
raids that were done against villagers.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
At this point in time Sean has a reputation for beating many leaders of the Khergit, and particularly the Sarranid Sultante.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Resuming from present day, Sean had been attempting to train and level his men, and had been travelling around the northern part of Calradia.</P>


<P>
He had discovered a band of deserters and decided to go for some easy pickings.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163253_1.jpg"/></P>


<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163402_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Expectedly, the deserting Nords were slaughtered and crushed by this band of warriors.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Oh cool! The weekly account has been settled! Still in the green.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163708_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways, being quite bored over the state of affairs and itching for a battle. Sean finds the Boyer Dhashwal alone on a patrol. As</P>


<P>
is usual for him, he decides to go ahead and battle the Boyer.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Cursed snow-blindness... This battle of 36 against 100... Goes as about exactly as you'd expect. A one-sided slaughter.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163910_1.jpg"/></P>


<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708163934_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Having scratched his minor itch for battle, Sean quickly discovers that the <b>Kingdom of Swadia</b> had declared war on the</P>


<P>
<b>Kingdom of Rhodoks</b>! This might be bad for our many Swadian soldiers... Of course, as I discovered, this would be bad in</P>


<P>
more ways than forcing brothers against each other.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Sean decides to travel southwards back into Rhodok territory when he encounters Count Despin's Party. Hoping to peck off a few forces,</P>


<P>
he wonders if he can pursue them. However <b>Count Reland</b> orders for Sean's appearance. So he heads towards <b>Uxkhal</b> where a healthy</P>


<P>
amount of men are stationed. Seemingly preparing for a siege.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164313_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Reland asks for Sean to follow him, and requests him to scout several times. He declines as he finds the work quite menial and frankly boring. Eventually</P>


<P>
he gives up following Reland's party and ventures into the wild, searching for more warbands to level his soldiers.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately he gets exactly what he asked for, as Swadian <b>Raich</b> approaches.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164542_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Shit! Now he'll see what it's like to be on the other side of a massacre. Hundreds of Swadians line up on the other side of the field as Sean's mercenaries</P>


<P>
approach a hill. Seeing the numbers, in spite of all sense of self-preservation, he orders his men to battle as they always had. As best as he could afford to</P>


<P>
anyways.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Charging on his Courser he tries to peck off archers as in his experience he found them (and Calvarymen) to be amongst the most dangerous of his adverseries. While</P>


<P>
the battle was violent and bloody. Sean and his party were at the very least seeming to manage against the first detachment. Bodies strewn across the battlefield,</P>


<P>
while horses without their riders gallop wildly. A chaotic confusion in the battlefield as any remaining semblance of tactics disappeared.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164627_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Of course, this was only the first detachment. While not to his surprise, but very much to his horror. He witnessed the second half of the 250 men approaching.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708164828_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
After the first initial defeat, Sean recovers enough to try one last stand...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708165105_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
16 men against 86... While the party had done quite a number, all it took was a single arrow to knock Sean off his horse unconsious.</P>


<P>
Upon recovery, he decided his life was worth more than honor, and he fled.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately the Count was quite persistent, and eventually caught Sean. The bastard! Seeing no choice as fight or not would end in defeat. He decided to follow</P>


<P>
what would've happened anyways...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708165123_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Upon surrender Sean had lost nearly all of his companions. Fortunately he was left his arms and armor. With a meager 3 men, he had to set out and rebuild his</P>


<P>
warband again. The only solace taken was that he would consistently make a 3000 denar profit each week due to the lack of wages to pay.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
So with this in mind, Sean had a set out across the few non-hostile villages (which basically only included the Kingdom of Rhodok and the Nords) and attempted to</P>


<P>
recruit villagers. Along the way Sean had to battle yet another Count. </P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708170646_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Sean unfortunately recognizes that this is not a Swadian. Rather a former Emir, who had defected from the Sarranids. However he can honestly remember if this was one of</P>


<P>
the many Emirs he battled, and nor did he care. Foreseeing this would be another lopsided massacre, Sean sacrifices a few men and flees with the survivors.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately this has proven to be quite the bad Spring, as in spite of this the Emir caught up, and decided to beat the living shit out of his party.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708170943_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Fortunately this time, Sean survives without getting held prisoner, and escapes. Continuing his recruitment of soldiers. He believes he should recruit as many Rhodok crossbow</P>


<P>
men, and find as many calvarymen to compensate against his enemies.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Yet again however, he is accousted by yet more armies...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708171431_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Unfortunately I cannot recount whether I actually won this or not... All I recall is that I was not taken prisoner after the first time. After the scars of March and Feburary,</P>


<P>
Sean continues his goal of recruiting more and more men.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
This episode concludes with the final party composition:</P>


<BR/>

<P>
<img src="screenshots/20210708172225_1.jpg"/></P>


<BR/>

<P>
This is going to be a very rough recovery.</P>

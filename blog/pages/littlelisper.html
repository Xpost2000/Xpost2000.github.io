<P>
Why is it so incredibly often for me to update this at midnight? Anyways, I decided to start replacing the C</P>


<P>
static generator.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
I replaced it with a lisp version of the static generator for BOTH page versions, that according to Windows was</P>


<P>
written in an hour and forty five minutes.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
I have no idea how I managed to write something that fast and have it not error out. It's a little longer than the</P>


<P>
C version as it's more "abstract" and more fitted for general template generation. Although you should really just</P>


<P>
be using a library.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
It's a weird mixin of hiccup style list structures with inline html as some cases will not trivially "compile" because</P>


<P>
I don't try to pretty print any of the output correctly.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
I should be able to use this to replace the projects page later... Will setup make file to generate in a bit from this</P>


<P>
setup.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
For some pretty hacky code, it's working okay I guess.</P>

<p id="display">Tutorial 3: Control Statements</p>
<div id="body">
<h1>The If Statement</h1>
<p>Now this lesson is unique because well. Multiple files</p>
<p>Yeah I took a small cutaway to type this, anyways the first source file</p>
<iframe src="src/src3/ifStatement.html" width="600" height="200"></iframe>
<div class="bd">
	<p>Behold the all useful If Statement</p>
</div>
<div class="b">
<p style="font-size: 35px; text-align:center;">Explanation</p>
<p>So say you want to make a decision. Once you make a decision what do you do before then?</p>
<p>You determine all the possible outcomes for the said decision usually in the form of</p>
<p>If this happens I might be ******. Or I might get a reward.</p>
<p>Well this is exactly what we're doing but in this case on one outcome is stated. (if test equals true)</p>
<br>
<p>The syntax for an If statement is relatively simple it goes like this</p>
<b><i>
<p style="font-size:15px;">If (Statement To Evaluate){</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">Do Stuff If It Is True</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">}</p>
</b></i>
<p>This one isn't too hard to understand so we move on from here.</p>
<h1>If & Else Statment</h1>
</div>
<p>Here is the second source file</p>
<iframe src="src/src3/ifElse.html" width="700" height="250"></iframe>
<div class="bd">
	<p>Code that is working as intended</p>
</div>
<div class="b">
<p>If you look pretty closely there is two new differences.</p>
<p>test is now equal to false, and we have a new else :D</p>
<p>What the else statement does is check for the opposite condition ( in this case false )</p>
<p>the standard else only works best on Booleans because there is not exactly an opposite for strings or ints.</p>
<p>Moving on!</p>
<h1>Else If Statement</h1>
</div>
<p>Source File Number 3</p>
<iframe src="src/src3/elseIf.html" width ="700" height ="350"> </iframe>
<div class="bd">
	<p>Usage of the else if statement</p>
</div>
<div class="b">
<p>just like the standard else statement else if also checks for other outcomes</p>
<p>however with else if you must specify the outcomes that can occur, and as a result</p>
<p>allows you to specify multiple outcomes and is much more flexible than else</p>
<h1>While Loop</h1>
</div>
<iframe src="src/src3/while.html" width="800" height="350"></iframe>
<div class="b">
<p>So from lego robotics or code.org or whatever you guys know what a forver loop is right?</p>
<p>well that is essentially what it is. The syntax is also relatively easy and is like this</p>
<b><i>
<p style="font-size:15px;">while (CONDITION TO EVALUATE AS TRUE OR FALSE)</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">perform if condition is true until it is false</p>
<p>Usually While Loops are used to make things go on forever as it's pretty simple to make it go forever.</p>
<p>In this example however I set a variable to evaluate and in this case every time the while loop is executed</p>
<p>the variable A is lowered so the while loop is false and it stops printing hello</p>
</b></i>
<h1>For Loop</h1>
</div>
<iframe src="src/src3/forloop.java.html" width="600" height="200"></iframe>
<div class="b">
	<p>Now guys from Robotics. Remember the normal loop?</p>
	<p>Yes again it's pretty much the same concept. The Syntax again is simple</p>
	<p style="font-size:15px;">for (Expression 1; Expression 2; Expression 3)</p>
	<p style="font-size:15px;">Execute code until one of the expressions are false</p>
	<p>As you can see it is very basic logic and well can actually be used to replace</p>
	<p>a While loop as it is less intensive by doing this</p>
	<b><i>
	<p style="font-size:15px;">for (;;;)</p>
	<p style="font-size:15px;">Do things</p>
	</b></i>
	<p>this code would perform a task indefinitely within the forloop being the expressions are empty</p>
	<p>the expressions are by default always true and thus there is nothing to prove incorrect</p>
	<p>Hope you guys also enjoyed this tutorial and see you later next time!</p>

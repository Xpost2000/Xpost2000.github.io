A software rendered tactics JRPG game and engine. It is written in C completely from scratch with SDL2 as it's only dependency, and features a multithreaded software renderer to perform postprocessing in real time. There is also an integrated level editor, and many more features! All assets exempting music and font are self-created.</P>

This was a dungeon crawler made for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023. It was my first time learning Unity, and combining this with midterms whilst being a full-time student, and a solo developer was very challenging! It was designed as a surreal survival horror dungeon crawler under the jam theme "Duality".</P>

<P>
A small wave-based survival game. This game was made in one week for minijam83 and was a take on the theme restriction which required dice. The main gameplay mechanic is the level layout which is randomized according to a dice as well as various player buffs or debuffs which are applied based on a set of randomly rolled adjectives.</P>

<P>
A roguelike take on Left 4 Dead made in the Godot Game Engine in one week for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge. This game effectively created a custom ASCII roguelike engine within Godot and features: raycast based visibility, Dijkstra map based pathfinding for mass actor support, and a simple map generation scheme. The 4 survivors of L4D are also present and have reasonably intelligent AI (they follow the player and know how to heal themselves.) This game features interpretations of all L4D1 special infected.</P>

</A>


<P>
KillBot was an arena survival platformer, and was made with a custom game engine in C++, with a web-based UI powered by the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). The engine is simple but supports event-driven animations, and the game itself has 3 bosses with several stages. This was my first publically released game. While it is a demo, the final game is not much of a deviation beyond the shown preview. The preview is really more a release-candidate.</P>

An isometric RPG game/engine written in C. It uses OpenGL for rendering graphics and features a dialogue system that supported conditionals. There was also an grid-based inventory system, and a basic combat system. Inspired by Baldur's Gate/Infinity Engine era RPGs.</P>

</A>


<P>
This is mistakenly called an ASCII roguelike despite not being a roguelike, though ASCII it is. It was a small game to do with PDCurses, and it was kind of cool to make. It's not very complicated and rather simplistic. Would be repeated again in various different projects like Wanderer. It is a short dungeon crawling adventure where you beat the Orc "Gorbalt the Cruel!"</P>

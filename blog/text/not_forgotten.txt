Not Forgotten
08/23/2021 07:43 PM

I know no one reads this so this is really just to reassure myself
that I haven't forgotten about whatever I did for this website, and also just
to make sure all the static generation still works.

Honestly I'm probably considering adding in a markdown library just to get more
nicer looking posts.

Hopefully the entire system isn't going to crash and burn, although considering it worked for
10+ posts... I don't think I have a reason to suspect that?

The Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Game of the Year Edition</H1>


<P>
This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. By far in my opinion probably the best</P>


<P>
Elder Scrolls game ever made.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
While it aged terribly in terms of graphics, has a lot of gameplay quirks that deter modern</P>


<P>
audiences. It also houses a very indepth world with fascinating histories and cultures. In comparison</P>


<P>
to other Elder Scrolls games, this is probably the only game in the series to show the diversity and</P>


<P>
uniqueness of the titular nation they take place in.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
This game is unforgiving to begin with, however like most old school RPGs, once you've passed the half-way</P>


<P>
point, you should be set for easy sails until you begin either of the DLCs.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Morrowind is frankly quite terrible in terms of gameplay depth, however it is very good at letting you imagine</P>


<P>
things. While the custom spell system is very cool, it's quite limited (although to be fair many games don't even</P>


<P>
really rival this...) and heavily impractical (thousands of septims for a spell that's barely better than a prebought one?</P>


<P>
What the fuck?)</P>

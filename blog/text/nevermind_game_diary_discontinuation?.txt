Nevermind Game Diary Discontinuation?

For obvious reasons it's probably too cumbersome to record what is essentially a playthrough
using just text.

So I'll probably just use it to store some interesting or noteworthy moments from those games.

Instead of a fullplaythrough-isque thing like I thought I was going to do. Somehow it takes a few hours
to get a mediocre piece of text to describe an hour of text.

Writing is hard, who knew?

Anyways at least it got me to refactor the blog generation code to be much easier since now it's basically
just doing a basic

(Please work correctly. I have no idea how this might show up
 ALSO TODO: get highlight.js or something. I kind of wish it would do AST based highlighting instead
 of regex highlighting though, since AST can be more accurate. Oh well.)

<pre><code class="language-lisp">
(let ((blog (install-blog "./text/"))
      (listings (generate-page-links blog))
      (links (map 'list #'text-link->page-link (loop for item in blog collect (getf item :link)))))
    (with-common-page-template
        :page-title "title here"
        :current-link-text "minibuffer-text"
        :body 
         ;; some list that represents HTML, which I can get from the blog files.
         ;; although this is meant to store a pgae index.
         ;; GENERATE-PAGE-LINKS, generates all the pages as well. I should probably separate that out.
         ))
</code></pre>

So outside of maybe naming reasons, it's pretty usable. I could probably compact installing blog instances into a full function to
just instantiate blogs through this. And setup some stuff so like

<pre><code class="language-lisp">
;; This would install my full blog instance plus batch script CMS
;; so it would create copies of my scripts to write-blog-entry and just source
;; them into my .bashrc so I could just invoke them anywhere... This seems to actually
;; provide a neat way of producing blog entries, since it hasn't bothered me yet, and seems
;; pretty fast and easy to do.

;; Even better, since this uses vim I could ssh and write blog entries too, so that's cool.
(install-blog-instance "text-location" "output-location")
</code></pre>

stupid-slideshow

This is a stupid slideshow program written in Rust. It is resolution
and aspect ratio independent. It uses a text based format, as those
are the most flexible format (just write a program to interpret them)
as well as being extremely easy to share and transfer. It supports
slide transitions and images, as well as basic layout. There is
hot-reloading which alleviates that issue. The filebrowser included is
primitive, and prone to breaking however the slideshow portion itself
is fine. Some called it `jerry-slides`. I do not have many opportunities to use
this as many presentations are often in group-work environments(as a student).

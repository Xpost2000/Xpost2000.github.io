<p id="display">Tutorial 2: Variables and printf</p>
<div id="body">
<p>So I'm going to assume first you want the code right? Here it is.</p>
<iframe src="src/tut2src.html" width="825", height="350"></iframe>
<div class="bd">
	<p>Not too hard is it?</p>
</div>
<div class="b">
<p>See a difference between this and HelloWorld? Well it's harder yeah. No not the fact there are variables.</p>
<p>printf is the difference from the previous println and let me introduce you to it!</p>
<h1>Printf The Superior Printing Function</h1>
<p>Printf stands for Formatted Printing! Not sure what formatting is?</p>
<p>say you created a language. Some symbols will stand for other things.</p>
<p>printf formats specific symbols. Here is the Symbol Table (The common ones anyways)</p>
<table style="width:85%; border: 5px solid black; margin:20px; padding:10px;">
<tr><th>Format Code</th> <th>In English</th> <th>What It Does</th> <th>Example Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td>%d</td> <td>Decimal/Double Precision Number</td> <td>Allows decimal numbers to print use %f for floats</td> <td>printf("%d",3.3);</td></tr>
<tr><td>%i</td> <td>Integer Number</td> <td>Allows strictly integers to print (characters also work cause ASCII)</td> <td>printf("%i", 1);</td></tr>
<tr><td>%c</td> <td>Character</td> <td>Prints integers to the appropriate ASCII code</td> <td>printf("%c", 25); or printf("%c", 'a');</td></tr>
<tr><td>%b</td> <td>Boolean (Java exclusive)</td> <td>prints whether a Boolean is true or not</td> <td>printf("%b", true);</td></tr>
<tr><td>%s</td> <td>String (array of Characters)</td> <td>prints an entire string</td> <td>printf("%s","O Hello!");</td></tr>
<tr><td>%x</td> <td>A Hexadecimal Integer</td> <td>prints a number in hexadecimal</td> <td>printf("%x", 512 );</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Didn't have enough of reading? Good here is another table for Escape Codes (Again common ones) Only works with ASCII Encoding</p>
<table style="width:85%; border: 5px solid black; margin:20px; padding:10px;">
<tr><th>Escape Code</th> <th>In English</th> <th>What it Does</th> <th>Example Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td>\n (or use %c with 0x0a)</td> <td>Make A Newline</td> <td>Skips to the next line</td> <td>printf("yest \n test");</td></tr>
<tr><td>\t</td> <td>Make a Tab</td> <td>Adds a Tab to current line</td> <td>printf("\tTest");</td></tr>
<tr><td>\b</td> <td>Backspace</td> <td>As if you pressed backspace</td> <td>printf("Test\b");</td></tr>
<tr><td>\'</td> <td>Quotation Mark</td> <td>Adds Quotation Mark</td> <td>printf("\'Oswald\'");</td></tr>
<tr><td>\"</td> <td>Double Quotation Mark</td> <td>Adds two Quotation Marks</td> <td>printf("\"A Human\"");</td></tr>
<tr><td>\\</td> <td>Backslash</td> <td>Adds Backslash</td> <td>openFile("C:\\MyPC\\Files\\abcd.txt");</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Notice how Quotation Marks and Backslashes have their own escape code.</p>
<p>This is mainly because Quotation Marks are used to declare strings so it would be read as if</p>
<p>you were making a string literal (Which you are likely not) and gives an error. Backslashes have no real technical</p>
<p>influence, and are likely because Java is based of C which was a Unix made language. The Unix File Directory System worked like this</p>
<p>Instead of C:\Thing\test it would be C:\\Thing\\test</p>
<h1>Back To Variables</h1>
<p>There are many variable types but here the ones you need to know.</p>
<table style="width:85%; border: 5px solid black; margin:20px; padding:10px;">
<tr><th>Type</th> <th>What it is</th></tr>
<tr><td>int</td> <td>a 4 bit numerical data type. Is 4 bits, suffices for most types of variables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>short</td> <td> 16 bit numerical data type. Is 16 bits, usage is tricky since you won't know the situations until you do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>long</td> <td> 32 bit numerical data type. Is 32 bits, usage is also tricky like shorts since it isn't easy to access most of the bits ( or use effectively at a beginner level).</td></tr>
<tr><td>char</td> <td>1 bit numerical data type. Is 1 bit, typically used for ASCII characters, can also store standard numbers but not decimals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>String</td> <td>An array of characters. Everything that a char is also applies to string but bits depends on length (or amount of chars)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Boolean</td> <td>A variable that can only be set to the value true or false. Represented by 1 or 0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Like most programming languages, Java provides the essential data types and leaves you to do things with.</p>
<p>Like for example you can use a int to determine the health an enemy has or something like attack damage.</p>
<h2>Variable Arithmetic</h2>
<p>Like all programming languages, Java allows you to do math or arthimetic with variables.</p>
<p>as you would expect doing the operations like division(/), multiplication(*), addition(+), subtraction(-)</p>
<p>works exactly as it should on integers and decimal numbers(float and double)</p>
<p>However. We are going to cover the more odd arithmetic</p>
<p><b>NOTE: It is impossible to do arithmetic on Booleans</b></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;"><b>String and Character Arithmetic</b></p>
<p>Now only addition is possible with Strings and Characters, and it is not called addition</p>
<p>rather it is called concatenation. It is simply putting the strings or characters together.</p>
<p>For Example: 'b' + 'c' = "bc" (Two chars = a string)</p>
<p>The same thing for strings</p>
<p>"abc" + "def" = "abcdef". Simple right?</p>
<p>Well. Hope you enjoyed this and learned something!</p>

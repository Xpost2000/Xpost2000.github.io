Here is a card listing of my projects whether they be games or general software, they are summarized briefly on this page with a thumbnail.<br>Feel free to click on the card titles to learn more!</P>


<P>

<A href = "https://github.com/Xpost2000/ASCII-Roguelike" class = "project-title" >
ASCII RPG</A>


<DIV class = "project-description" >
<IMG class = "project-thumb" src = "projects/ascii//ascii.png" >
</IMG>


<P>
This is mistakenly called an ASCII roguelike despite not being a roguelike, though ASCII it is. It was a small game to do with PDCurses, and it was kind of cool to make. It's not very complicated and rather simplistic. Would be repeated again in various different projects like Wanderer.</P>

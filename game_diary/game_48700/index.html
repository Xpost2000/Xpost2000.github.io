Mount & Blade: Warband</H1>


<P>
Mount and Blade: Warband is one of those classic Medieval PC games. It's like Totally Accurate Battle Simulator,</P>


<P>
but you get to participate in the battles!</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Turns out, the ability to participate in battles is really awesome! Also since I'm into medieval combat and knights</P>


<P>
and swords. This happens to be a great game to play. It's a dated game though (even for when it came out), but man is</P>


<P>
it a lot of fun. Even in a singleplayer, though I've heard multiplayer is one of the mainstays of the game.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
As this is a sandbox game. There's not really much to say about the story except for the fact this is about me as I try</P>


<P>
to conquer Calradia with a Warband of a hundred men (and growing!)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Enjoy my journey as I live or die into legend! (Or according to the retirement page, I become a thief... Fuck.)</P>

Yay more CMS-ish things
07/08/2021 04:13 PM

So anyways as stated in a previous entry here. I hacked up a bunch of shell scripts and
page generators to assemble the world's jankiest little Content Management System, if you dare
to call it that.

Now with the introduction of game diaries the page generator has been buffed up to basically make a
"blog-install" very quick to do.

Although I could use some more refinement on making "blog-like" pages much faster. Please note this CMS
is basically only designed for this website and my computer.

I cannot guarantee trying any of this will work on other computers (It should require any standard SBCL installation
with a fresh linux install to work optimally.)

This CMS should compile all of it's pages incredibly fast (exempting game diaries which requires an http request), and
writing entries should be very easy.

You do need vim in order to write entries however (or you can just change the write-blog-entry.sh script to change the editor,
since I don't use the $EDITOR environment variable yet.)

Doing the remaining pages?

No I didn't forget this site existed, I just don't really like doing web development or design. Okay I've
just kind of been lazy and maybe did forget about this website for a few seconds or something like that.

If I don't forget to do anything later, I'll probably write or reuse a similar static content generator
for the remaining portions of the website. Mostly the project parts.

I'm likely just going to stick with this style of the website (old VI style), and probably add a few nice
features like theme switching...

I've been doing web development for a classmate's organization, which while I'm not too plussed with having
to use these frameworks or particularly happy with using them. I did find a bit of enjoyment during some select
portions.

I'm definitely going to need to reorganize this repository to be more clear, and also probably change the static
generator into something a little more advanced than a printf machine.

Though I don't suspect anything complicated will be required for a pretty long while, and I can probably just hand-code
the static generators in a special way in basically C scripts.

If I really can't bear to do it in C (when it gets too cumbersome), I'll probably just switch to doing it with a python or
common lisp script or something like that. I do endeavor to handwrite as much of this website as I possibly can without
resorting to external dependencies because I do not wish to wait for thousands of packages to install on a Windows 7 machine
(Professional still has support!)

Also either way, this is much more sane to do in my opinion. I'm still rather green as far as things are still concerned, so maybe
my rant is a bit unfounded. Okay I'm not going to lie, doing some styling does make me a little giddy sometimes.

Anyways that's it for now.

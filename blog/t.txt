Last few works of the day. Small polish things.

Camera is getting some polish functionality added in, since
this is my last amount of actual work I designated...

So while I didn't get a complete skeleton. I guess it's not too
terrible, however this is like the "stretching" it point... Although
this makes me confident enough that it can be finished mostly by saturday
with sunday to do last minute polish or some asset stuff...

God how I wish Godot had an IMGUI cause that was probably the worst part of
this experience.

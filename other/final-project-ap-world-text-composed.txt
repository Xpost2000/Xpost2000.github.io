1 Ruminations on the People's Republic of China
===============================================

  I am the second generation of my family to be born in China, my
  younger sister beat me by about twelve years.

  My parents and grandparents are first generation Chinese immigrants
  likely from south east China given the dialect of Chinese we speak. My
  grandparents were farmers when they were younger and China and I won't
  show pictures, but my grandfather actually looked remarkably dashing
  in his prime.

  That's besides the point. While there were few questions in total
  asked, the brunt of the information is based on analysis of small yet
  fairly significant questions that help paint a picture of how an
  approximate Chinese citizen would've lived during the late 20th
  century.

  This interview was conducted with my parents and I asked them very
  simple questions, and prodded along with answers. I must paraphrase
  everything that is said because I cannot read, nor write Chinese, and
  nor am I able to type this properly without a large inconvenience.

  Let's begin.


1.1 How was the Education System like in China?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Both of my parents ultimately agreed that the Chinese education system
  was not bad, and you get the textbook answer of it was very
  strict. Although in comparison to the American Education system, that
  answer is infinitely applicable. However if there was anything to note
  about what my parents said they stated things that implicated that the
  Chinese Education System was depedendent on being very *studious*. My
  mom admittedly not a very great student or even very booksmart was
  able to tell me that at the time _literacy was an important topic_,
  which appears to correlate with data of the literacy rating in China
  rising since 1982. She recalls having poetry classes where she would
  analyze classical poems. Not only did she have to analyze it however,
  but she also had to *memorize it by heart*, infact so much so that
  even today my mom was able to recite one of these poems. Unfortunately
  I cannot understand it due to language barrier.


1.2 How was life outside of School? What did you do in your freetime?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  _Was there anything memorable?_

  The short answer was no. My mother stated that there was nothing
  really memorable, and there was basically no such thing as
  freetime. She didn't have anytime for these sorts of things and
  couldn't spend time with friends either. Her days were going to
  school, then coming home to do homework, and finally do chores and
  repeat again.

  While this is more related to the other question, my mother did recall
  going on field trips during her school year. She states that they
  would go to a theater and watch films of military
  showcases. Essentially the only trips she had recalled were
  _propaganda trips_, more specifically the viewing of propaganda
  films. Actually to this day sometimes she does actually look at
  Chinese military marches, she did say she found them quite
  entertaining.

1.2.1 Context Comment
---------------------

  The most interesting thing being significance of military propaganda
  during the time of the Cold War. The China that stands today is an
  heirloom of the fall of the Qing Dynasty, which hard to believe fell a
  little over a century ago, with the last people to have ever known it
  dying out only a couple years. The Qing Dynasty fell due to China's
  inability to cope with Western Superiority and due to internal
  political strife and made the way for new political movements.

  First was _Sun Yat-Sen_ who became a revolutionary due to his belief
  that simple reforms and initiatives such as the _Hundred Days of
  Reform_ and _Self Strengthening_ movements were simply not enough to
  fix China. He decided to find the _Kuomintang / Guomindang_ and
  eventually the _Kuomintang_ was engaged in a war with the newly formed
  _Communist Party of China_ lead by Mao Zedong. This would be known as
  the _Chinese Civil War_ and the result of this was the eviction of the
  _Kuomintang_ to Taiwan and the formation of the *People's Republic of
  China*.

  Why is this significant? Mao Zedong was a tyrant and a dictator, and a
  commonality that can be observed amongst many dictators and
  tyrants. They want to maintain power, and do so through fear or
  sometimes awe. Therefore a common tactic to showboat their power and
  strength is to perform many military displays.  While these things are
  invariably directed at foreigners, these things also have a very large
  influence on the domestic population. This particularly true in China
  which has a history of _ethnocentrism_, and massive pride in it's in
  culture. In other words China has within it's *histories a baked epic
  of nationalism*, and after equally epic humiliations at the hands of
  the west, what better way to restore pride in it's people who have
  seen the effects of such humiliations than to show that the nation is
  rising once again?


* 1.2.1.1 Examples of Military Parades used for similar propaganda effect

  It's not unusual to use parades or ceremonies to radiate power or
  glory. However it is notable that in many historical authoritarian
  regimes their displaces are often much more extreme. As a result these
  are often the most impressive displays in the world, and quite
  approprietely make for perfect propaganda simply because of how
  perfect they are.

<P>
I'm probably going to be doing minijam 83.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Oh joy, more game jams! I will choose to use Godot again,</P>


<P>
because I have no time to write an engine in time (nor do I think I should do that</P>


<P>
for a game jam).</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Also man, it's been a while since I made a proper game... So I guess I'm going to</P>


<P>
be very rusty...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Limitation and Jam starts in 58 minutes... I'm going to aim to come up with a basic</P>


<P>
idea (even if it isn't fun), that can be finished within 2 days (IE: I should be done by Saturday</P>


<P>
night if all goes well.)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I'm setting up a Mercurial Repository. Hopefully this goes well. I'll go to sleep and wake up and</P>


<P>
try to brainstorm something... If I can't, well it's not too late to quit.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I need to work within Godot's common paradigm more since the last time I did this with 7DRL, it wasn't</P>


<P>
so hot. While I did technically finish the game, it was a major pain in the ass to modify because I made</P>


<P>
a mini-engine within Godot, with no time to make proper tooling. So it was extraordinarily difficult.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
If all goes well, I should be able to make a platformer or maybe some sort of text adventure with minimal</P>


<P>
interaction (like a interactive fiction game with a platformer as a "minigame" or something?)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I need something that doesn't take much implementation time, however art is going to be an issue. Although</P>


<P>
if my idea requires little implementation work... I can finish most of the game early and perhaps just dedicate</P>


<P>
more time to assets like art and sound...</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Dread... Already doing it.</P>

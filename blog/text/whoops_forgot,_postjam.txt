whoops forgot, postjam

Whoops I kind of forgot to write a post-jam entry.

Anyways I guess this is that entry. As all game-jams it's quite the
hectic weekend. I'm very pleased that in my opinion the game quality / polish is
higher (even regarding assets excluding music).

So that means I'm getting faster at making games I guess.

Although I have not made games in a hot minute, so my code architecture skills regarding games
is kind of bricked, and not as good as it could be. (This is multiplied in Godot as I typically don't
use external game engines.)

Anyways, should anyone wonder what I've been doing the past couple of days. I was binging on anime. I got
around to watching Re;Zero, and it was horribly depressing. Great show though. For some reason I've been binging
anime a lot more frequently in the past year, and I'm not really sure if that's out of character for me or not.

That'll be all then!

Minibuffer Update
3/3/2021 7:20 PM

I added an update to this new website. Firstly it should be slightly better on mobile...
At least that's what I'm hoping for.

However more importantly now you can now use the mini-buffer for some more Unix editor style
navigation. The mini-buffer should also work on mobile, and the blog generator was updated to
propagate the mini-buffer change everywhere.

I'll need to make a new generator as I'm increasingly getting more complicated requirements (even
if those requirements are rather simple.)

Anyways that's it for now.

The next/previous entry links do not work, because the crappy static generator isn't flexible enough
for that unfortunately.

Styling Updates with More Theming
5/22/2021 12:38 AM

I read some more about CSS to do this, and I decided to look into flexbox a bit more to
solve the unresponsive part of the projects page. Thankfully it was a pretty quick thing instead
of me throwing a bunch of shit together like usual.

Also I'm now targetting CSS3 so I can use variables for styling. There are now a few new styles based
off of some old computing items.

Default - Dark Theme
Light   - Light Theme
Plan9   - A paper/beige theme inspired by the ACME editor.
Borland Blue - A blisteringly nostalgic colorscheme from Borland's DOS IDEs.

That's all! I also need to fix the way styles are "changed" since it can clutter the DOM if spammed too
frequently. Although I'm not very worried about that happening, if I'm going to be honest.

Also I should probably switch my static generators into a different language to make them less limited. The
C thing was really just an exercise, although the generators build and generate the pages lightning fast, so there's
that.

<P>
It has been absolutely forever since I've actually written on this site haven't I?</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways, after my first year of college a lot of stuff happened. I've lost an uncountable</P>


<P>
amount of sleep, and have been inordinarily stressed.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I tried to pickup a new hobby, and got I'd say mediocre at art. I'm actually very proud of it!</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I'll put up a section in a little bit for my artwork, since it's something that makes me happy to</P>


<P>
do. It's mostly anime style art, which I know has some stigma, but I like to draw it so I'll keep it</P>


<P>
that way.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I've been vetting and documenting some select projects, which turns out to be a lot of work and it's good</P>


<P>
thing I still remember how everything works for most of them. Definitely the ones I picked at least.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
That'll be all for now!</P>

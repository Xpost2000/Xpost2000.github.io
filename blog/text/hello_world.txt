This is a manually typed blog page.
However this time, we're generating it from a text file.

This is a very basic text file format, where the first two lines are special, the rest of
the text is just a paragraph. I don't think I'll support any markdown/markup yet, so that sucks...
But that's okay.

This is just the bare minimum to generate a page.
Hopefully this looks correct. This was generated from a C file.

Date unfortunately has to be manually specified atm.

I don't build the index automatically yet unfortunately. That's for next time!

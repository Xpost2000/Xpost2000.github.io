<P>
I'm adding a game diaries thing so I can write down my gaming</P>


<P>
experiences.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Which is frankly the stupidest and most unoriginal thing, but who cares right?</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Games are fun, and I have a pretty big backlog to clear (although SteamDB says I've played</P>


<P>
80% of the games I have in my library. In reality I've played like maybe 30/100 something I own.)</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
For now this'll probably just be my Steam games, as in the in-progress page automatically builds from</P>


<P>
steam information.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Unfortunately I cannot write about my console games since my consoles are broken. Though I would love to</P>


<P>
regale the God Of War and Little Big Planet days.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
Anyways it's a crapton of infrastructure to automate all of this, so oddly enough this website is robust in</P>


<P>
the weirdest way. Though surprisingly it's not a lot of code to generate most of this.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
1678 lines of code for CSS + Lisp which is cool. There's 362 lines of C from when I was still using that generator.</P>


<P>
</P>


<P>
So I guess overall I'm pretty satisifed with the way this website "grew." Back when I handwrote all the HTML to now</P>


<P>
writing a thing that writes the HTML for me. Website builds very fast and iteration time is relatively quick in my opinion</P>


<P>
for my needs (the C generator can be compiled and run fresh in less than a second, the common lisp generator takes one second</P>


<P>
to build all pages (from the makefile, each individual page is built fast, so I'll just chalk it to Windows being bad at process</P>


<P>
forking.))</P>

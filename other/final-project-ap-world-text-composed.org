  I am the second generation of my family to be born in China, my younger
  sister beat me by about twelve years.
  
  My parents and grandparents are first generation Chinese immigrants likely
  from south east China given the dialect of Chinese we speak. My grandparents
  were farmers when they were younger and China and I won't show pictures, but
  my grandfather actually looked remarkably dashing in his prime.
  
  That's besides the point. While there were few questions in total asked, the brunt
  of the information is based on analysis of small yet fairly significant questions
  that help paint a picture of how an approximate Chinese citizen would've lived during
  the late 20th century.
  
  This interview was conducted with my parents and I asked them very simple questions,
  and prodded along with answers. I must paraphrase everything that is said because
  I cannot read, nor write Chinese, and nor am I able to type this properly without
  a large inconvenience.
  
  *Let's begin.*

** How was the Education System like in China?
   Both of my parents ultimately agreed that the Chinese education system was not
   bad, and you get the textbook answer of it was very strict. Although in comparison
   to the American Education system, that answer is infinitely applicable. However if
   there was anything to note about what my parents said they stated things that implicated
   that the Chinese Education System was depedendent on being very *studious*. My mom 
   admittedly not a very great student or even very booksmart was able to tell me that
   at the time _literacy was an important topic_, which appears to correlate with data
   of the literacy rating in China rising since 1982. She recalls having poetry classes
   where she would analyze classical poems. Not only did she have to analyze it however,
   but she also had to *memorize it by heart*, infact so much so that even today my mom
   was able to recite one of these poems. Unfortunately I cannot understand it due to
   language barrier.
   
   My dad's experience in China was a bit more descriptive, and revealed more interesting things.
   He recalled more interesting memories of his time in school, including helping a friend cheat on
   his exam, and consequently resulting in a lower score for himself. He states he thought the education
   in China was very good, however when it came to how China was like he stated China was very poor in
   his time. There was fair mention of not having much food, even rice being somewhat rare which for a
   Chinese person is quite incredible. Instead he would eat a fried dough which was probably something like
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao][youtiao]]. He also told me that while he never really want on trips like mom did, he remembered having to do
   farming and living in large bunks with other people. This may be part of a _collectivized farming system_.

** How was life outside of School? What did you do in your freetime?
   _Was there anything memorable?_
   
   The short answer was no. My mother stated that there was nothing really memorable, and
   there was basically no such thing as freetime. She didn't have anytime for these sorts
   of things and couldn't spend time with friends either. Her days were going to school,
   then coming home to do homework, and finally do chores and repeat again.
   
   While this is more related to the other question, my mother did recall going on field trips during
   her school year. She states that they would go to a theater and watch films of military 
   showcases. Essentially the only trips she had recalled were _propaganda trips_, more
   specifically the viewing of propaganda films. Actually to this day sometimes she does
   actually look at Chinese military marches, she did say she found them quite entertaining.

*** *Context Comment / Analysis*
   The most interesting thing being significance of military propaganda during the time
   of the Cold War. The China that stands today is an heirloom of the fall of the Qing
   Dynasty, which hard to believe fell a little over a century ago, with the last people
   to have ever known it dying out only a couple years. The Qing Dynasty fell due to China's
   inability to cope with Western Superiority and due to internal political strife and made
   the way for new political movements.
   
   First was _Sun Yat-Sen_ who became a revolutionary due to his belief that simple reforms
   and initiatives such as the _Hundred Days of Reform_ and _Self Strengthening_ movements
   were simply not enough to fix China. He decided to find the _Kuomintang / Guomindang_
   and eventually the _Kuomintang_ was engaged in a war with the newly formed _Communist Party of China_ 
   lead by Mao Zedong. This would be known as the _Chinese Civil War_ and the result of this was
   the eviction of the _Kuomintang_ to Taiwan and the formation of the *People's Republic of China*.
   
   Why is this significant? Mao Zedong was a tyrant and a dictator, and a commonality that can be observed
   amongst many dictators and tyrants. They want to maintain power, and do so through fear or sometimes
   awe. Therefore a common tactic to showboat their power and strength is to perform many military displays.
   While these things are invariably directed at foreigners, these things also have a very large influence on
   the domestic population. This particularly true in China which has a history of _ethnocentrism_, and massive
   pride in it's in culture. In other words China has within it's *histories a baked epic of nationalism*, and after
   equally epic humiliations at the hands of the west, what better way to restore pride in it's people who have seen
   the effects of such humiliations than to show that the nation is rising once again?
   
   Now about my dad's side of the answer which opened up to the probable implementation of a collectivized agricultural
   system. Another common pattern that occured as a result of the rise of communist governments in the 20th century was
   the centralized acquisition of resources. Specifically _state-mandated_ collection of resources, which in many cases
   resulted in _collectivized farms_ in which people would work on a farm, and the output of which would be given to the
   state. This was common in the _Soviet Union_ and of course the _People's Republic of China_. Collectivized farming was
   implemented to allow for the equally state-motivated industrialization that most communist countries engaged in.
   
*** *Examples of Military Parades used for similar propaganda effect*
     It's not unusual to use parades or ceremonies to radiate power or glory. However
     it is notable that in many historical authoritarian regimes their displaces are
     often much more extreme. As a result these are often the most impressive displays
     in the world, and quite approprietely make for perfect propaganda simply because of
     how perfect they are.

*** *Continuity*
    What can be seen through these small remenants of an essentially bygone political experiment, there is one major
    consistency that remains throughout China's large history.
    
    That which is the continued _ethnocentrism_ of the Chinese people. Augmented by a more restrictive
    government, now this ethnocentrism is reinforced by state-censorship and fairly blatant propaganda. Many countries
    have overbearing nationalism, but few countries in the present day still defend their nationalism with censorship
    to the degree that modern China still does. In spite of the progress made since the time of the _Soviet Union_, China
    is still _extremely conservative in it's values in practice._

    In the late 19th century the ill-fated but well spirited _Boxer's Rebellion_ was an example of that. While the "Boxers"
    were quite effective, their belief that their fists were harmonious and divinely supported lead to high death toll for the
    Chinese. Relating to martial arts in the modern day is the case of Chinese MMA Fighter [[https://youtu.be/_UvRavszvPY][Xu Xiaodong]] and his controversal mission
    to disprove the practicality Chinese Martial Arts, inspite of the fact the government actively censoring him and punishing him
    by making a him a social outcast for doing so. The government believes that much like the Boxers did, that they would not want to
    be susceptible to western influences and attempted to fight back, of course a government is much more effective against one man than
    a small society against relatively overequipped armies. If not something that could damage the pride of Chinese culture one can also
    observe the extremely minor case of comparing China's general secretary Xi Jinping likeness to that of beloved childhood figure
    Winnie the Pooh. In fact this is so damaging and insulting it is nationally [[https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-40627855][censored]]. Of course this may also be seen as an attempt
    of an overbearing government carefully controlling media, although this is the most ridiculous case. That would also be another continuity
    that appears with restrictive regimes ( the careful control of information ), however that's not the topic of this. A more serious case of
    Chinese nationalism occurred with the [[https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/chinas-angry-young-nationalists/][Hong Kong and Mainland China issue]]. 

    If one takes it further another continuity that has been upheld indirectly as a result of this nationalism is the self-isolation of China.
    During the classical period, China was amongst the most powerful nations of the world and was rightfully the *Middle Kingdom*. For many dynasties
    this was true, however the advancements of Western Europeans during the _Early Modern period_ lead to the replacement of most influencing states.
    In spite of all this, China still believed it was completely self sufficient and had no need to advance, even going as far as ordering fleets to
    *show* how advanced and glorious they were. Even though a mere few decades later the Western Europeans would enter the Age of Colonization and
    bolt past the rest of the world in terms of power.
    
    Now in the modern era it isn't very difficult to see that this odd self-isolation, which only serves to detriment the country still stands. While of
    course modern transportation reduces that gap, it's not difficult to see China still attempts to isolate as much as it can. It's no state secret that
    China censors the usage of Google and it's platforms. Not only that but China has *it's own intra-net as it were*. Weibo, Wechat, Tecent's QQ, Baidu
    are common household names in more developed areas of China. It's not the fact they exist which is concerning, but the fact *they are the only options*.
    This "intra-net" allows companies which have associations with the government to monitor it's citizens and curate content carefully. Ultimately this results
    in an echo-chamber as it were. It took hundreds of years and epic embarassments for China to finally accept that it needed to get with the times, and when
    they tried that they were beaten viciously by stronger nations. The question is how long will it take before this echo-chamber will leak? Life in Modern China
    is quite similar to classical China in this one way.
    \\

    /*There is China, then everyone else.*/ \\
    There may not be a middle kingdom anymore, but China will always be the center of their world.

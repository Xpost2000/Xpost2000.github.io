Probably Doing 7DRL

So for this week up to the start of 7DRL I'm going to setup some
base code, for a relatively generic RL with some bog-standard algorithms.

This is to avoid spending too much time on the first few days doing "engine"
work. Or at least to get a feel for how I'd like to structure the code in Godot,
as I'm choosing to work in Godot to avoid having to deal with crossplatform and
graphics programming.

It also does a lot of other things for free to avoid me having too much pain.

It should be under the gd-rogue-skeleton or something like that. The actual 7DRL
game is going to be a fork of that project.

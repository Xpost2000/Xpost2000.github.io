This Site.

Yes, this is definitely meta. This is one of my web development projects. The website went through older iterations and such,
generally which shows my growth as a web developer (which is not much as I don't actively really do it.) A retro computing aesthetic
to resemble an EMACS/VI session was chosen as I really like using those editors, and I think most websites look too generic. The best
experience for this website is to go fullscreen, and use keyboard. Due to the odd design, it is difficult to work this on mobile (much how
mobile VI is not a fun time.)

This is the "sequel" to the previous project. It now sports an OpenGL renderer that used shaders to support a kind of wonky looking
underwater effect. Also there was mouse aim and a basic camera/frustrum culling solution for things. Delta-time was also finally used
so the game was roughly framerate independent.

Minijam 83

I'm probably going to be doing minijam 83.

Oh joy, more game jams! I will choose to use Godot again,
because I have no time to write an engine in time (nor do I think I should do that
for a game jam).

Also man, it's been a while since I made a proper game... So I guess I'm going to
be very rusty...

Limitation and Jam starts in 58 minutes... I'm going to aim to come up with a basic
idea (even if it isn't fun), that can be finished within 2 days (IE: I should be done by Saturday
night if all goes well.)

I'm setting up a Mercurial Repository. Hopefully this goes well. I'll go to sleep and wake up and
try to brainstorm something... If I can't, well it's not too late to quit.

I need to work within Godot's common paradigm more since the last time I did this with 7DRL, it wasn't
so hot. While I did technically finish the game, it was a major pain in the ass to modify because I made
a mini-engine within Godot, with no time to make proper tooling. So it was extraordinarily difficult.

If all goes well, I should be able to make a platformer or maybe some sort of text adventure with minimal
interaction (like a interactive fiction game with a platformer as a "minigame" or something?)

I need something that doesn't take much implementation time, however art is going to be an issue. Although
if my idea requires little implementation work... I can finish most of the game early and perhaps just dedicate
more time to assets like art and sound...

Dread... Already doing it.

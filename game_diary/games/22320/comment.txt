This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. By far in my opinion probably the best
Elder Scrolls game ever made.

While it aged terribly in terms of graphics, has a lot of gameplay quirks that deter modern
audiences. It also houses a very indepth world with fascinating histories and cultures. In comparison
to other Elder Scrolls games, this is probably the only game in the series to show the diversity and
uniqueness of the titular nation they take place in.

This game is unforgiving to begin with, however like most old school RPGs, once you've passed the half-way
point, you should be set for easy sails until you begin either of the DLCs.

Morrowind is frankly quite terrible in terms of gameplay depth, however it is very good at letting you imagine
things. While the custom spell system is very cool, it's quite limited (although to be fair many games don't even
really rival this...) and heavily impractical (thousands of septims for a spell that's barely better than a prebought one?
What the fuck?)

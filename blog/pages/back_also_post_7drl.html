<P>
Anyways I've finished 7DRL a week ago or something. Used Godot, and had</P>


<P>
a jolly time writing bad code.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Also spending time away from C, and too much time in javascript land.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Not fun, because there's no error checking. I don't want to use typescript,</P>


<P>
but I probably should've.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Static generation now has a better directory listing, but might require some</P>


<P>
implementation patches. Works well enough for this but I should probably decide</P>


<P>
on a consistent API.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I do count "./", and "../" as valid directories, although I'm not exactly sure if I should?</P>


<P>
For now to get past them just start counting from index=2.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
TODO, use a higher level language for this? Or don't since I don't seem to touch this very</P>


<P>
often.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Anyways I'm trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAhWIO1Ra6M.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAhWIO1Ra6M.</a></P>


<BR/>

<P>
Which reminds me that this doesn't support links. So I'll need some minimal markdown support.</P>


<P>
I don't escape HTML in here, which is a problem... I'll work on that next time I guess.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I'll handle that later I guess.</P>

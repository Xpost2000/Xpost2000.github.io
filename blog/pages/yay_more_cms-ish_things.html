<BR/>

<P>
So anyways as stated in a previous entry here. I hacked up a bunch of shell scripts and</P>


<P>
page generators to assemble the world's jankiest little Content Management System, if you dare</P>


<P>
to call it that.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Now with the introduction of game diaries the page generator has been buffed up to basically make a</P>


<P>
"blog-install" very quick to do.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Although I could use some more refinement on making "blog-like" pages much faster. Please note this CMS</P>


<P>
is basically only designed for this website and my computer.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I cannot guarantee trying any of this will work on other computers (It should require any standard SBCL installation</P>


<P>
with a fresh linux install to work optimally.)</P>


<BR/>

<P>
This CMS should compile all of it's pages incredibly fast (exempting game diaries which requires an http request), and</P>


<P>
writing entries should be very easy.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
You do need vim in order to write entries however (or you can just change the write-blog-entry.sh script to change the editor,</P>


<P>
since I don't use the $EDITOR environment variable yet.)</P>

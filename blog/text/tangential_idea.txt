Tangential Idea

I think I have a basic idea that's technically only
tangential to the limitation...

But this idea does literally require the usage of dice since
it's shoehorned into the world.

So dice are required by definition in the game design or at least a 
form of it... Otherwise it's a standard game with lots of RNG, which
will be done via dice. Which means I might allow physical rerolling and shaking
or something (Can't draw it for shit... So I'd have to hide it).

I'm going to eat breakfast.

Page Generation in Order?

Okay now we have page generation using a pretty scuffy C program.

Why did I pick C? It allows me to access my inner peace. No but
seriously it's pretty calming to do C since the language is small and
simple. Sure I am doing a lot of redundant work, but honestly it's a
small issue in the grand scheme of things.

The program is just for now, it may either be refactored or rewritten in another
language.

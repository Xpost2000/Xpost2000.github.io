These responses provide an insight into the lives of a pretty ordinary Chinese citizen
in the mid 80s to 90s. My parents are first generation immigrants from China and I decided
to start off by asking them, what how was their life in China. Primarily how their schooling was
because according to them home-life was pretty boring. There was essentially little to no time to
really do anything else but schoolwork and chores.

The short answer is that China’s education system was stricter and much more dependent on being
studious. My mom noted that if one thing she wasn’t very good at things such as math, however she
recalled that the education system emphasized literacy, an example she gave me was poetry. They
analyzed poetry and would essentially have to recite it, they had to know it by heart. My mom was
able to recite one poem although my limited knowledge of Cantonese did not allow me to understand
it. I asked her if she had any particularly memorable moments and she said nothing was particularly
memorable. She didn’t really have time to spend with her friends, she went home and just did chores
and schoolwork. She did note that there were field trips, and I recall she told me that sometimes
they would have trips to see Chinese propaganda ( military style propaganda primarily, actually ever
so often she still watches Chinese military parades today. ) My dad added on more to what his
experience was like. Education-wise he said it was very good, and he didn’t have anything
particularly special to say about things. He was a very smart student although he was not good at
retaining information in terms of memorization ( which is odd because for as long as I’ve known him,
he knows a surprising amount of trivia about a seemingly endless array of topics. ) He even once
helped a friend cheat on an exam, by doing his friend’s exam for him after he had finished his. He
recalled that his friend ended up doing better than he did. He was also caught cheating once and as
a result had his class’ exam scores annulled. Although after his experiences on school he got more
to the information I did want to know.  How China was like back then. Reading about the effects of
Communism on the Eastern Hemisphere made me wonder what it was like for my parents. I had known my
grandparents were agricultural / rural people, and unsurprisingly my parents also to a degree lived
very agriculturally. Dad said China was very poor during those times, and there was very little to
eat. Even rice was kind of rare and sometimes he would have this fried dough. He also recalled every
so often students would be sent to work in farms for a time, every 6 months or so he would have to
go. He also mentioned having to live in bunks with other people and it was quite rowdy. It was one
thing to read about these things, but it was another to hear it directly from my parents who had
lived through times like these. Although I will note despite the impoverished state of China, my dad
did happen to not think it was all bad, and my parents are still somewhat nationalistic about China
despite these things. My Cantonese is not exactly that great so I may have misinterpreted some
parts, although it still paints an interesting picture where Chinese citizens were built to mainly
be laborers and certainly civil servants. Some of us believe that our educational system is designed
to create templated human beings. In a way that is one of the main goals of education, seemingly the
best yet worst way to educate yourself, is to educate yourself. However it can’t be denied that
without guidance you risk a higher chance of absorbing incorrect information because you don’t know
enough to evaluate right or wrong. Is it better to be templated with right information but less
autonomy? Or molded with incorrect information with full autonomy?
 
Thoughts of Leaders of the time. Deng Xiaopeng? Mao

Mom : 

I did not actually get a lot about this, but generally from what she spoke it was pretty positive.
She states Deng Xiaopeng was responsible for the opening up of China, and ultimately viewed it as a
good thing. She didn't really say anything negative about him. Essentially she notes how Deng Xiaopeng
helped modernize China in a sense and that was all.

Mao Zedong she states (which I recognized), was dead when she was a child and she stated that she didn't
know who he was and the significance of it for a while. When I asked her her thoughts on him or rather more
specifically how she was educated about him. I was actually surprised with the fact that she stated history
wasn't taught very much. She did state though that she was brought up that Mao Zedong is viewed as a "king" like
figure, ( at the very least a figure of very high significance ), and that it was just one of those things that people
just knew in China. As if it were common sense. She did however mentioned that she was taught that Mao Zedong did do one horrible thing
was during the Chinese Civil War. I could not accurately interpret what she said although she mentioned that unfortunate peoples were left dead, 
and I can only guess that this refers to the _Long March_ in 1934-1935 which appears to be the most accurate match to the description

I'm Jerry, I am an avid gamer, and I am also an avid game programmer! I publish independent games on itch.io under the online alias Xpost2000.</P>



<P style = "margin: 1.5em" >
I am currently an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science.</P>



<P style = "margin: 1.5em" >
I've been programming small games, demos, custom engines, and participating in various game jams for as long as I could remember.</P>



<P style = "margin: 1.5em" >
I am primarily a C++ and C programmer, and I develop games from scratch with custom game engines and tools! I have graphics programming experience with building software renderers, or using APIs like OpenGL for hardware acceleration. I also have experience working with game engines like Unity.</P>



<P style = "margin: 1.5em" >
My projects are divided into:<ul><li><b>Projects</b>: C / C++ primarily showing technical abilities as a programmer. Gameplay is secondary, but still present!</li><li><b>Game Jam Projects</b>: C# or C++, Small complete experiences which are more gameplay oriented than technical.</li><li><b>Legacy Projects</b>: Older projects that I use to remind myself of how far I've come.</li></ul></P>



<P style = "margin: 1.5em" >
Below are summaries of my projects. You can learn more, and view more materials such as videos and code samples by clicking on the thumbnails!</P>




<h2 id="projects" style="font-size: 32px;">Projects:</h2>
These are my main-stay projects, which are representative of either my most technically interesting work, or best/polished work.
<br>Usually, these are custom game engine projects, tech demos, and games written with C or C++. There are a few non-game projects from time to time.

A bullet-hell game with a custom game engine. It is written in C++ and supports Direct3D11, OpenGL, and a multithreaded software renderer through a graphics abstraction that simplifies the porting process. As usual, assets are all produced by hand, and this time LUA is used as the choice of scripting language for stages.</P>

This was a dungeon crawler made for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023.

A roguelike take on Left 4 Dead made in the Godot Game Engine in one week for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge. This game effectively created a custom ASCII roguelike engine within Godot and features: raycast based visibility, Dijkstra map based pathfinding for mass actor support, and a simple map generation scheme. The 4 survivors of L4D are also present and have reasonably intelligent AI (they follow the player and know how to heal themselves.) This game features interpretations of all L4D1 special infected.</P>

KillBot was an arena survival platformer, and was made with a custom game engine in C++, with a web-based UI powered by the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). The web-based UI was cool at the time, although it's just a novelty of a by-gone era (since I don't know of any game that still uses HTML for their actual UI anymore). The engine is simple but supports event-driven animations, and the game itself has 3 bosses with several stages. This was my first publically released game.</P>

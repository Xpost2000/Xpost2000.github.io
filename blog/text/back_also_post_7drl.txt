I should probably not use C, but this is still kind of fun.

Anyways I've finished 7DRL a week ago or something. Used Godot, and had
a jolly time writing bad code.

Also spending time away from C, and too much time in javascript land.

Not fun, because there's no error checking. I don't want to use typescript,
but I probably should've.

Static generation now has a better directory listing, but might require some
implementation patches. Works well enough for this but I should probably decide
on a consistent API.

I do count "./", and "../" as valid directories, although I'm not exactly sure if I should?
For now to get past them just start counting from index=2.

TODO, use a higher level language for this? Or don't since I don't seem to touch this very
often.

Anyways I'm trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAhWIO1Ra6M.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAhWIO1Ra6M.</a>

Which reminds me that this doesn't support links. So I'll need some minimal markdown support.
I don't escape HTML in here, which is a problem... I'll work on that next time I guess.

I'll handle that later I guess.

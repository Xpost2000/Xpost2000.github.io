The date sorting is now fixed.

All I do is now parse the date string within the text entries to generate
the blog listing.

For some reason the dos2unix line ending tool I used, as stated last time, breaks
the date information on the files, which makes it very difficult to sort using the filesystem.

Using the date within the file is more reliable.

So yeah that works now!

<P>
Seems like the case as the last entry is kind of borked.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I know why it's borked although it'll take a few days to fix that up. I could get a quick</P>


<P>
temporary though for this particular instance, but I don't really feel like working this out today.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
So I'm just going to change the old entry for now to make it look correct.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
I'll probably just have a:</P>

<P>
#+BEGIN_LITERAL_HTML</P>


<P>
#+END_LITERAL_HTML</P>

<P>
as a quick fix later on... Basically I guess I'd be reinventing the org-mode syntax... Which would inadvertently</P>


<P>
just cause me to reinvent org-mode, in which case wouldn't I be better off writing the generator in elisp?</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Let me just be grateful that modern ELISP and Common Lisp are close to interchangable because of the cl library at this</P>


<P>
point... So most of the blog generator might straight up just work if I change the function names to the emacs-equivalent.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
But Emacs is a pretty heavy editor to install for such a blog / website instance... I'd rather choose to just use a small lisp</P>


<P>
implementation or just use SBCL since it's the standard one.</P>


<BR/>

<P>
Who knows? Writing a markup language wouldn't really take more than a few days I guess, but I can just stick with the tagged regions in</P>


<P>
the TROFF style, so I guess that wouldn't be too terrible.</P>

Line Ending Broke Stuff.

Fuck, the dos2unix conversion fucked up all the date-created because it overwrote
the file creation dates...

Now all of the dates are wrong... I have no idea how (READ-LINE) handles newlines, so
this was the best thing to do as Windows Line Endings seemed to break stuff.

Now I have to redo it... Later. Or manually parse the date from the "date published" sectio,
which is thankfully maintained.

Looks like I'll need some markup parsing pretty soon, of some sort anyways

Seems like the case as the last entry is kind of borked.

I know why it's borked although it'll take a few days to fix that up. I could get a quick
temporary though for this particular instance, but I don't really feel like working this out today.

So I'm just going to change the old entry for now to make it look correct.

I'll probably just have a:

#+BEGIN_LITERAL_HTML
#+END_LITERAL_HTML

as a quick fix later on... Basically I guess I'd be reinventing the org-mode syntax... Which would inadvertently
just cause me to reinvent org-mode, in which case wouldn't I be better off writing the generator in elisp?

Let me just be grateful that modern ELISP and Common Lisp are close to interchangable because of the cl library at this
point... So most of the blog generator might straight up just work if I change the function names to the emacs-equivalent.

But Emacs is a pretty heavy editor to install for such a blog / website instance... I'd rather choose to just use a small lisp
implementation or just use SBCL since it's the standard one.

Who knows? Writing a markup language wouldn't really take more than a few days I guess, but I can just stick with the tagged regions in
the TROFF style, so I guess that wouldn't be too terrible.

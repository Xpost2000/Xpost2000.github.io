Improvements to the Generator
4/15/2021 10:20 PM

I finally remembered I still have a website, and am now back on some things.

In the meantime I was reading a bit about linear algebra for game development and doing
high school things. My non-existant self-esteem took a bad beating, but anyways I'll maybe
try to update the rest of the site.

I will stubbornly stick to the C static content generator since it's pretty short and easy
to modify, especially when using the printf formatter as my "template engine".

Now of course I could replace it with a semantic text template engine whenever I feel like writing
one (since I love typing explicit code, so that's a thing). Also conveniently this "refactor" fixed
a bug in the static generation since I forgot realloc takes size in BYTES. Whoops! Anyways I'm going
to be doing more game things later or something.

No one really reads this anyways so have fun!
